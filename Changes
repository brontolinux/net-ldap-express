Revision history for Perl extension Net::LDAP::Express.

0.12 Sat Jun 28 20:04:49 CEST 2014
     - Fixed bug 96007: misleading error message when the connection
       with the directory server fails. The module now returns the
       correct error message that comes from Net::LDAP itself.

0.11 Mon Dec  6 14:11:14 CET 2004
     - error in the number of test in 01basic.t: fixed

0.10 Sat Dec  4 18:31:32 CET 2004
     - applied patches from Gordon Lack to do exact searches: exact
       searches are now supported;
     - better management of undefined values, so that tests don't
       issue warnings any more;
     - in particular, now the $ldap->error for error code 0 (that
       means: no error) is a null string, and not undef.
       I hope this doesn't break any existing application, but in
       case it does please contact me!
     - test scripts have been deeply revised
     - filters are now built differently: attribute/search-string
       are not coupled with a boolean operator any more: now there
       is a single boolean operator in the whole filter
     - no delegation yet, sorry guys... :-(


0.03, 0.04, 0.05 have been created, but never released to the public

0.02  Sun May 18 17:00:38 CEST 2003
	- modified Makefile.PL to require Test::More (no specific
	  version)
        - added the sort_by parameter, so that search results from
	  simplesearch are sorted by the specified attributes
	- optimized code in search methods; now, for each instance,
	  search parameters are calculated once

0.01  Mon Apr 14 14:08:17 2003
