     - applied patches from Gordon Lack to do exact searches: exact
       searches are now supported;
     - better management of undefined values, so that tests don't
       issue warnings any more;
     - in particular, now the $ldap->error for error code 0 (that
       means: no error) is a null string, and not undef.
       I hope this doesn't break any existing application, but in
       case it does please contact me!
     - test scripts have been deeply revised
     - filters are now built differently: attribute/search-string
       are not coupled with a boolean operator any more: now there
       is a single boolean operator in the whole filter
     - no delegation yet, sorry guys... :-(

	- modified Makefile.PL to require Test::More (no specific
	  version)
        - added the sort_by parameter, so that search results from
	  simplesearch are sorted by the specified attributes
	- optimized code in search methods; now, for each instance,
	  search parameters are calculated once
